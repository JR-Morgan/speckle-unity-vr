# speckle-unity-vr

A VR Sample project for a Speckle Unity VR app.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-RGPZJIHf4

This project demonstrates a minimal VR app to visualise and modify 3D models in VR.
3D data can be sent through any [Speckle](https://speckle.systems) connector, and received in the VR application.

The sample project is built to showcase the Speckle Unity connector, and how developers can easily build custom tools and applications that integrate with Speckle.
